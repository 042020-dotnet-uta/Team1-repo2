    <div>A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.

        The term recipe is also used in medicine or in information technology (e.g., user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe, Latin for take, usually abbreviated as Rx or the equivalent symbol (â„ž).</div>
